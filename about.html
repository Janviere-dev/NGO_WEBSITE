                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Belyse Mukayiranga and a dedicated group of colleagues founded Hope for Tomorrow in 2024 to uplift and empower rural youth. The organization's journey began in the rural areas of Rwanda, where the founders witnessed the significant challenges young people face, particularly in health, education, and socioeconomic opportunities. These experiences shaped their vision to create meaningful change within their communities by addressing critical needs and providing support.</p>
                <p>Hope for Tomorrow was established to tackle issues such as limited access to sexual and reproductive health education, barriers to girls' education, and the lack of opportunities for rural youth to develop their full potential. The founders recognized that by addressing these fundamental challenges, they could help transform lives and create lasting positive change.</p>
